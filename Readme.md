This is a _non official_ repository of TOSEC. See [project readme](./readme.txt) for more details about TOSEC.
Please do not report issues or merge requests here use the offical channels linked in the project readme file.

Compared to the offical release:
- Script folder is removed
- all DAT filenames are renamed to get rid of dates encoded in the filename (see rename.sh)
- all files use unix newline to ease GIT use
